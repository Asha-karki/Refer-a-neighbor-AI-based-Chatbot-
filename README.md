This work is a part of MARK5826 Product analytics subject @UNSW 2020


The Chatbot's primary three intents are to provide company information, account sign-up, and the neighbor's recommendations. For details on Chatbot, refer to the conversational flow chart below. The Chatbot is developed on the IBM Cloud using IBM Watson Assistant. Moreover, Node-Red has been used for wiring the flows of Chatbot, and it is integrated into Facebook. This Chatbot is built as the project of MARK5826 subject focusing on the refer a neighbor chats.
